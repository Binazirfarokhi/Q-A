# Q-A
what is library and framework?
a "library" is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functions for developers to use in their applications, while a "framework" is a structured set of code that defines the overall architecture of an application, dictating how the code should be organized and providing a foundation for building upon, essentially controlling the flow of the program rather than just offering individual tools; library is a pre build code that you just use , but in framework there are some part that you have to optimzie to make that code work on your project.

Fire base authentication error: 
üö® "Access to script at 'Log-in.html' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross-origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: chrome, chrome-extension, chrome-untrusted, data, http, https, isolated-app."

this is becasue: 
Why is this happening?
Your HTML file is being opened from file:// protocol instead of a local server (e.g., http://localhost).
Browsers block cross-origin requests from file:// for security reasons.
Firebase Authentication requires requests to come from a proper web server.
Solution: Run a Local Server
Instead of opening the HTML file directly, start a local development server:
cross-origin requests are not acceptable for Fire-base Authenctication.

**Using VS Code Live Server Extension (Easiest)
Open the project in VS Code.
Install the Live Server extension (if not already installed).
Right-click on index.html or login.html and select "Open with Live Server."
This will start a local server (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500 or http://localhost:5500).
Try logging in again.**

.env File Still Pushed to GitHub Despite .gitignore
Why is this happening?
If the .env file was added to Git before adding it to .gitignore, it will still be tracked.
Solution: Remove the .env File from Git History
Remove the file from tracking (but keep it locally):
git rm --cached .env

===================================

Commit the change:
git commit -m "Removed .env from tracking"
Push the changes to GitHub:
git push origin yourNameBranch
Now, the .env file should no longer be pushed to GitHub.
====================================
What is .gitignore ?
.gitignore is a special file used in Git to tell Git which files/folders should not be tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
Why do we need .gitignore?
Some files should not be shared in a repository, like:
Secret keys (.env files)
Node modules (node_modules/ folder)
Log files (.log files)
===========================
3Ô∏è‚É£ What is .env ?
.env (environment file) is used to store secret keys and configuration settings.
Instead of hardcoding API keys in your code, you store them in a .env file.
Why use .env?
Security: Keeps secrets out of your public code.
Flexibility: Allows different settings for development and production.========
